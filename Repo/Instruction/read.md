# Winly Start — project rules, plan & architecture

**Winly Start** brings the Windows 10 Start menu back to Windows 11. It is an open-source
(MIT) .NET 8 WPF desktop app that *replaces* the Windows 11 Start menu experience
(Start button click, Windows key, Ctrl+Esc) with a faithful Windows 10 style menu —
left rail, A–Z app list, and a live-tile-style tile board — while following the
Windows 11 theme (light/dark, accent colour, transparency) and using Windows 10 style
visuals (acrylic blur, square corners, slide-up animation, tile hover/press effects).

GitHub: https://github.com/Mahi-BD/WinlyStart  ·  Local: `/home/mahi/Project/WinlyStart`

## Build / run rules (house rules)
1. After any change, **compile it yourself** (`dotnet build src/WinlyStart -c Release`) and
   confirm **0 errors** before calling a task done. On Linux the project cross-compiles with
   `EnableWindowsTargeting=true` (use `~/.dotnet/dotnet` if `dotnet` is not on PATH);
   it can only *run* on Windows 10/11.
2. **Minimal code, minimal RAM.** No third-party UI/MVVM frameworks, no WinForms, no
   Windows App SDK / WinUI, no CommunityToolkit. Plain WPF + P/Invoke + `System.Text.Json`
   (source-generated). Every dependency must justify its working-set cost.
3. **Never harm the OS.** No injection into `explorer.exe`, no DLL/registry patching of
   system components, no killing/suspending shell processes, no modifying HKLM.
   Everything Winly Start does is user-mode, HKCU-only, revertible by closing the app.
   The Windows 11 Start menu is *not* disabled — it is intercepted; quit Winly Start and
   Windows is exactly as before.
4. Runs as a **normal user** (`asInvoker`). Never require or auto-request elevation.
5. **Theme follows Windows 11** (registry, live-updated) — never hard-code a colour that
   Windows exposes. Visual *style* follows Windows 10 (square corners, Segoe MDL2 glyphs,
   acrylic tint, 4 px tile gutters, accent-coloured tiles and list headers).
6. Save instructions to `/Repo/Instruction`, scripts to `/Repo/Script`,
   test/scratch files to `/Repo/Temp`. User data lives in `%LocalAppData%\WinlyStart\`
   (`settings.json`, `tiles.json`, `usage.json`) — never inside the install folder.
7. Keep `README.md` (user-facing) and this file (developer-facing) in sync when behaviour
   or layout changes.

## Target
- Windows 11 (all builds; acrylic via DWM system backdrop on 22H2+, composition-attribute
  acrylic fallback on older builds and Windows 10).
- .NET 8 Desktop Runtime (framework-dependent build) — a self-contained single-file build is
  produced by CI for users without the runtime.

## How the "replacement" works (no OS harm)
| Trigger | Mechanism | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Windows key** tap | `WH_KEYBOARD_LL` hook (`Core/StartHook.cs`). On Win-down we let the key through **and** inject a harmless unassigned virtual key (0xE8) so Windows sees a "combo" and never opens its own Start. On Win-up with no other key pressed → toggle Winly Start. | All Win+X combos keep working natively. Same trick AutoHotkey users have relied on for years. |
| **Ctrl+Esc** | Same hook; swallowed and toggles Winly Start. | |
| **Start button click** | `WH_MOUSE_LL` hook. If a left-click lands inside the Start button rectangle (found through UI Automation, `AutomationId = "StartButton"` inside `Shell_TrayWnd`, cached and refreshed periodically) it is swallowed and Winly Start toggles. | Right-click (Win+X menu) passes through. Works with left- and centre-aligned taskbars. |
| **Anything we missed** (touch gesture, Win key while an elevated window is focused) | `SetWinEventHook(EVENT_SYSTEM_FOREGROUND)`. When the foreground window belongs to `StartMenuExperienceHost.exe`, Winly Start shows itself and takes focus; the Windows 11 menu light-dismisses. | Slight flicker in this rare path only. |

Limitation: low-level hooks cannot see input while an **elevated** window is focused (UIPI).
In that case the fallback row above kicks in. This is by design — we do not run elevated.

  48px      248px + scrollbar        6 tile units (3 medium) or 8
```
- Window 648 × 640 (settings: height, tile columns 6/8). Square corners, no title bar,
  `ShowInTaskbar=false`, topmost while open, hides on deactivate / Esc / Win key.
- **Left rail**: hamburger (expands to labelled 248 px overlay), then bottom-aligned:
  user (name + account picture → Change account settings / Lock / Sign out),
  Documents, Pictures, Settings, Power (Sleep / Shut down / Restart).
- **App list**: "Recently added" (≤ 7 days, top 3 + Expand), "Most used" (top 6 from our
  own launch counters), then `#`, `A`–`Z`, `&` headers. Header click → alphabet jump grid
  (available letters enabled). Start-menu sub-folders show as expandable folders.
  Typing while the menu is open filters the list inline; Enter launches the first match.
  Right-click app → Pin to Start / Unpin, More ▸ (Run as administrator, Open file location),
  Uninstall (opens Apps & features).
- **Tiles**: groups with editable names; sizes Small 1×1 (48), Medium 2×2 (100), Wide 4×2
  (204×100), Large 4×4 (204). 4 px gutters. Accent-coloured background, app icon centred,
  name bottom-left on Medium+. Drag to rearrange (first-fit packing), right-click →
  Unpin / Resize / More / Uninstall. Layout persisted to `tiles.json`.
- **Animation**: open = slide up 24 px + fade in 200 ms (ease-out); close = fade 100 ms.
  Tile hover = light border; press = scale 0.97. List item hover = 10 % overlay.
- **Backdrop**: acrylic. Tint `#CC1F1F1F` (dark) / `#CCF2F2F2` (light), or the accent colour
  when Windows "Show accent colour on Start and taskbar" is on. Solid when transparency is off.

## Windows 11 theme integration (`Core/Theme.cs`)
Registry (HKCU), live-refreshed via `SystemEvents.UserPreferenceChanged`:
- `…\Themes\Personalize\SystemUsesLightTheme` → light/dark (Start follows *Windows mode*).
- `…\Themes\Personalize\ColorPrevalence` → accent on Start.
- `…\Themes\Personalize\EnableTransparency` → acrylic vs. solid.
- `…\DWM\AccentColor` (ABGR) → accent brush.
Settings allow forcing Light/Dark.

## App catalogue (`Core/AppCatalog.cs`)
- **Desktop apps**: `*.lnk` / `*.url` under both Start Menu `Programs` folders
  (`%ProgramData%` and `%AppData%`), first-level sub-folder = Start folder, deeper levels
  flattened into it. Created-time drives "Recently added". Watched with `FileSystemWatcher`.
- **Packaged (Store/UWP) apps**: enumerated from `shell:AppsFolder`; items whose
  parent-relative parsing name contains `!` are AUMIDs. Launched with
  `IApplicationActivationManager` (fallback `explorer.exe shell:AppsFolder\<AUMID>`).
- **Icons**: one path for both — `IShellItemImageFactory::GetImage` → `GetDIBits` (top-down
  BGRA) → frozen `BitmapSource`. Loaded lazily on a single background worker, only at the
  sizes needed (32 list, 24/48/96 tiles), cached per app.

## Memory discipline
- Virtualised, recycling `ListBox` for the app list; icons loaded on demand and frozen.
- No `System.Drawing`, no WinForms `NotifyIcon` (tray icon is 60 lines of `Shell_NotifyIcon`).
- Working set trimmed (`SetProcessWorkingSetSize(-1,-1)`) after the menu hides (setting).
- Release build: `ReadyToRun`, `SatelliteResourceLanguages=en`, `DebugType=none`,
  `UseSystemResourceKeys`, no PDBs shipped.

## Verified on Windows (2026-09-08, build 26200.8037, light theme, centred taskbar)
Tested live on a Windows 11 Pro box (self-contained build). Confirmed working:
- Windows key opens/closes the menu and the **Windows 11 menu is suppressed**; Ctrl+Esc opens it.
- Start-button click opens it (button located via UIA at a centred taskbar), with proper foreground.
- Type-to-search filters the list; clicking a tile or list item launches the app; the menu then
  light-dismisses; clicking outside dismisses it. Theme (light/accent) is picked up live.
- ~65–165 MB working set, no exceptions in `error.log`.

Fixes made during that testing (all in v0.1):
- **Win-key mask.** The unassigned `0xE8` dummy key does *not* register as a chord on build 26200, so
  the mask uses `VK_CONTROL`, and the lone-tap key-up is **swallowed and re-emitted** (dummy + tagged
  Win-up) — injecting during the key-up and letting it pass queues the dummy too late.
- Tile press/launch threw because WPF freezes the template's `ScaleTransform`; each tile now gets its
  own mutable transform on first interaction (`EnsureTransform`).
- A short post-show "deactivation grace" re-asserts foreground when Windows churns focus on open, but
  must bail when the menu is already closing (else launching an app re-opened the menu).
- Opt-in trace to `%LocalAppData%\WinlyStart\debug.log` via env `WINLYSTART_DEBUG=1`.

Second round of live fixes (also verified on the box):
- **App-list icons were blank.** `Icon` reads size 32 but `SetIcon` only raised `Icon` for size 24, so
  the async load never refreshed the binding. It now always raises `Icon`.
- **Default icon.** Both the list and the tiles fall back to the Segoe MDL2 `AppIconDefault` glyph
  (`&#xECAA;`) whenever the shell returns no icon — driven by a `DataTrigger` on the source being null,
  so it also covers the moment before an icon loads.
- **Auto-hiding scrollbars.** The thin bar is hidden and fades in while the pointer is anywhere in the
  scrolling area. This needs the ScrollViewer to be *templated* (`AutoHideScroll`): a
  `RelativeSource FindAncestor` binding from inside the ScrollViewer's own template resolves before the
  bar is attached to the tree and the trigger never fires — that approach was tried and does not work.
- **Groups, Windows 10 style.** Dropping a tile below the last group creates a new group; an unnamed
  group shows a "Name group" hint; click the header to name/rename (Enter commits, Esc reverts) and it
  persists to `tiles.json`. `Pack()` now also closes whole empty rows, so the board no longer shows the
  large blank bands that stored high row indices used to leave.

Third round (all verified live):
- **No focus rectangle.** The black outline round the app list was WPF's default focus visual on the
  focused `ListBox` — `FocusVisualStyle="{x:Null}"`.
- **Group header is not an edit field until you click it.** It renders as plain text (with a
  "Name group" hint when empty) and becomes a real bordered text box on click, like Windows 10
  (`TileGroupVm.IsEditing`). Enter commits, Esc reverts.
- **Groups move.** Drag a group header to reorder; a click (no drag) renames instead.
- **Right-click on empty board space** → Add program or file… / Add website… / Settings… / About.
  Added items are stored in `custom.json` as `custom:<guid>` entries, merged into the catalogue by
  `AppCatalog.AddCustom`, launched via the shell (`AppEntry.CustomTarget`), so an .exe, a shortcut,
  any file, or a URL all work and get a tile.
- **Configurable left rail.** `Settings.Rail` drives the rail's middle section (Documents, Downloads,
  Music, Pictures, Videos, Network, Personal folder, File Explorer, Settings, Calendar) — edited from
  the Settings window, matching Windows 10's "Choose which folders appear on Start".
- **Calendar.** Ticking Calendar adds a rail button that opens `CalendarWindow`.

Fourth round (verified live):
- **Close buttons did nothing** on Settings / About / Calendar: they relied on `IsCancel`, which only
  closes windows opened with `ShowDialog()`; these are opened with `Show()`. Each now has an explicit
  `Close()` handler. (InputWindow is modal, so its Cancel was already fine.)
- **Calendar rewritten** (`CalendarWindow`): previous · current · next month side by side, custom
  day cells (not the WPF `Calendar` control, which neither scales nor colours per day). The month
  grids sit in a `Viewbox` so every element — day buttons included — scales with the window; the
  window is resizable and its size is remembered in `calendar.json` (recorded on `SizeChanged` *and*
  snapshotted on `Closing`, so it persists even if the user never resized that session). Clicking a
  day shows a note editor on the right (autosave, 400 ms debounce); days with a note are amber, the
  selected day uses the accent (amber border when it also has a note), today has an accent border.
- **Import / export** of all notes as JSON (exact round trip) or iCalendar `.ics` (one all-day
  `VEVENT` per note; SUMMARY = first line, DESCRIPTION = whole note). Import accepts all-day and
  timed `DTSTART`, unfolds continuation lines, prefers DESCRIPTION over SUMMARY, and appends when a
  day already has a note. Verified: two-event `.ics` imported (merge + timed event), `.ics` exported.

Fifth round — professional redesign + live tiles (verified live):
- **Dialog design system** (`UI/DialogStyles.xaml` + `Core/Theme.cs` `Dlg.*` brushes, driven by
  Windows 11 app-mode light/dark + accent). Settings, About, Add-website and Calendar are rebuilt
  around cards, Windows-11 toggle switches, flat combos, an accent slider, primary/secondary buttons
  and a dark title bar via DWM (`UI/Dialog.cs`). Settings also gained a sticky footer and scrolls.
- **Live tiles** (Windows-10-style, `UI/LiveTiles.cs` + the tile template's second "live face").
  Windows 11 has no live-tile platform, so these are our own faces for apps where we have real data:
  a built-in **Calendar** tile (next note), the **Clock** tile (live time), and **Photos** (a
  slideshow from the Pictures folder). The face slides up over the icon and back, staggered per tile
  by `LivePhase`; a 1 s timer runs **only while the menu is open**. Per-tile on/off via the tile's
  context menu (`Tile.Live`, persisted); small tiles are never live, as on Windows 10.
- **Built-in Calendar app** (`builtin:calendar`) appears in the app list and is pinned by default;
  `Launcher.BuiltinHandler` opens it inside Winly Start.
- **Smoother tile drag.** Dragging now reflows live: the dragged tile parks in the cell under the
  pointer and the others glide out of the way (`AnimatedPack` animates `Canvas.Left/Top`); on drop the
  tile eases into place instead of snapping. Resize/unpin also animate. Group-header drag shows an
  accent insertion line (`GroupInsertLine`) and drops at the indicated index.
- **New app icon** (`Repo/Script/make_icon.py`): a modern accent-gradient plate with four rounded
  white tiles and a soft shadow, rendered at 4× and downsampled; the `.ico` carries 16–256 px frames.

Sixth round (verified live):
- **Calendar stretches.** The month grids no longer sit in a `Viewbox` (which letterboxed a short, wide
  window) — they fill the space and the `UniformGrid` day cells stretch, with the day numbers scaled
  from the actual cell size (`ScaleDayText`).
- **Clicking a day never navigates.** Selecting a day from the leading/trailing month used to re-centre
  all three months; it now only selects. Use the arrows to change month.
- **Note categories.** `CalendarData` gains `Categories` (id/name/#RRGGBB) and `NoteCategories`
  (date → id); the note text stays in `Notes`, so existing files and JSON/ICS import-export are
  unchanged. Day cells take their category colour, the note panel has a category picker, the footer a
  legend, and **Categories…** opens `CategoryWindow` to add / rename / recolour / delete (deleting one
  falls its days back to the first category).
- **Live tile text no longer collides with the tile name**: the live panel reserves the name strip
  (bottom margin), empty title/big parts collapse instead of reserving a line, the big value sits in a
  `StretchDirection=DownOnly` Viewbox so a long time shrinks rather than being cut, and a gradient
  scrim sits behind the name on photo faces.
- **Settings fits without scrolling**: 980 px wide, two columns of cards, plus an **Account picture**
  card (`Settings.ProfileImagePath`) to choose a custom picture or fall back to the Windows one.
  `UserInfo.PicturePath` prefers the override, `UserInfo.WindowsPicturePath` ignores it, and the rail
  reloads via `LoadUserPicture()` on save.

Seventh round — v1.4.0 (verified live):
- **Website tiles get the site's favicon and a live preview.** `Core/WebAssets.cs` fetches the
  favicon (declared `<link rel=icon>`, else `/favicon.ico`) and the page's own preview image
  (`og:image` / `twitter:image`), caching both under `%LocalAppData%\WinlyStart\web`. The favicon
  becomes the tile/list icon and the preview is the live face, refreshed at most every 30 min
  (`WebAssets.ThumbnailLifetime`) while the menu is open. **Note:** we use the image the site
  publishes as its own thumbnail rather than embedding a browser to screenshot the page — that would
  mean a WebView2 dependency and a large working set, against the house rules.
  ⚠️ A cached favicon must be decoded with `ShellIcons.LoadFile` (`img:` prefix): putting the PNG
  through `IShellItemImageFactory` returns the generic "picture file" icon, not the image.
- **The menu opens where the Start button is.** `Position()` now centres the menu on the Start
  button for top/bottom taskbars (a centred taskbar centres the menu; a left-aligned one lands left
  once clamped to the work area). `Settings.OpenAtCorner` forces the old corner behaviour.
- **Start-button click no longer falls through to the Windows menu.** The cached button rectangle
  went stale because the taskbar re-centres whenever an app opens or closes: the cache TTL is now 2 s,
  it refreshes on every foreground change and on any near-miss click, and the hit test has 3 px of
  slack. Verified with 8 consecutive clicks and 6 Windows-key taps — every one opened Winly Start.
- **Calendar month moved into the title bar** ("Calendar — September 2026"), freeing the header row.
- Version is **1.4.0** (csproj + manifest).

Eighth round (verified live):
- **The expanded rail matches the icon rail.** The hamburger view had its own hard-coded Documents /
  Pictures / Settings rows, so it disagreed with the configurable icon rail. Both now bind to the same
  `RailItemVm` list built by `BuildRail()` (`RailList` for the icons, `RailFlyoutList` for the labelled
  rows), with the user row above and Power below.
- **Hairline outline.** A 1 px `Rs.Divider` border (`Outline`, inside `Root` so it fades with the menu)
  separates the menu from the taskbar and the desktop.
- **User-added items are editable.** Tiles and app-list rows for custom items show **Edit…**
  (`AppEntry.IsCustom`), which reopens `InputWindow` pre-filled. That window now doubles as the editor:
  it detects a URL vs a path, shows a **Browse…** button and validates existence for files, and
  validates the scheme for websites. `AppCatalog.UpdateCustom` saves and clears the cached favicon and
  preview when the target changes, so a new site re-fetches its own assets.

Ninth round — v1.5.0 (verified live):
- ⚠️ **Regression fixed: the menu had stopped being resizable.** Rewriting the expanded-rail block in
  the previous round deleted the `TopGrip` / `RightGrip` / `CornerGrip` Thumbs, which sat between the
  rail and the flyouts in the XAML. The handlers still existed, so it compiled with zero warnings and
  the loss was silent. They are restored (corner grip at `ZIndex 96`, above the outline).
- **Much less auto-arranging.** `Pack()` no longer collapses empty rows inside a group: tiles stay in
  the cells they were dropped in, gaps included. Only a gap at the very *top* of a group is closed so a
  group cannot float away from its header, and genuine overlaps are still resolved.
- **Groups are explicit.** The board's right-click menu has **New group**, which creates an empty,
  named group that survives (`TileGroup.KeepEmpty`, persisted) instead of being auto-pruned; dropping a
  tile in clears the flag. The group header has its own context menu — **Rename group** / **Remove
  group** (removing one with tiles asks first).
- Version **1.5.0** (csproj, manifest, installer, CI).

Tenth round — v1.5.1 (verified live):
- ⚠️ **Dragging a tile into another group could silently fail.** The live drag preview kept re-placing
  the tile in the *source* group as the pointer moved past it, which grew that group's canvas over the
  group being aimed at; the drop then hit-tested back into the source. Worst case the tile was left
  stranded on a far row (row 8), leaving a big gap.
  Three changes: the preview only runs while the pointer is over the source group and puts the tile
  back at its starting cell as soon as the pointer leaves; the preview row is clamped to
  `LastContentRow` so a group cannot stretch downwards without limit; and, decisively, every group's
  canvas rectangle is **snapshotted at drag start** (`CaptureGroupRects` / `GroupAt`) so mid-drag
  reflow cannot move the drop targets. The drop is now hit-tested from the **pointer**, not the tile
  centre.
  Verified all three directions: up into an earlier group, down into a later one, and into an **empty**
  group (the case that stayed broken after the first fix).

Microsoft Store submission (2026-09-09):
- Product **Winly Start** reserved in Partner Center as an **EXE or MSI app** (unpackaged Win32).
  MSIX was rejected on purpose: a packaged app cannot install the low-level hooks the whole product
  depends on. Product id `f0f7a659-0dc8-4389-919f-e55d8daaed01`.
- ⚠️ **The GitHub release URL cannot be the Store package URL.**
  `github.com/.../releases/download/...` answers **302** with a signed, expiring
  `release-assets.githubusercontent.com` link, and Partner Center refuses it:
  *"The package URL redirects to another URL. Provide a download URL without redirection."*
  The installer is therefore mirrored on GitHub Pages, which serves it **200, no redirect**:
  <https://mahi-bd.github.io/WinlyStart-downloads/WinlyStart-Setup-1.5.1.exe>
  (repo `Mahi-BD/WinlyStart-downloads` — deliberately separate so 50 MB binaries never enter this
  repo's history). **Every release must be copied there and the Store package URL bumped**, or the
  Store keeps shipping the old build.
- Store logos are generated, not photographed: `docs/store/logos/` holds a 1080x1080 box art and a
  720x1080 poster. Partner Center rejects anything smaller, so the mark is *redrawn* at that size by
  the generator rather than upscaled from the 256 px icon.
- Age rating came back **ESRB Everyone / IARC 3+** from the IARC questionnaire (All Other App Types,
  "no" to every content question).
- The certification notes spell out the two user-mode hooks up front - a tester who finds
  `WH_KEYBOARD_LL` without that context is likely to flag the app.
- ⚠️ **The rating sat at "Incomplete" for a non-obvious reason**: the IARC *Terms of Use* consent
  checkbox at the bottom of the ratings summary was unticked, which silently disabled **Save** and
  kept **Submit** greyed out. Answering the questionnaire and previewing is not enough - the box has
  to be ticked and the summary saved.
- ⚠️ **Package validation lies about being stuck.** The page claims ~30 minutes, does not refresh
  itself, and showed Malware + Code sign spinning for over an hour. A hard reload after submitting
  showed both had **passed** long before. Reload before assuming a run has wedged.
- **Submitted 2026-09-09, status "In review"** (3 business-day SLA). Malware and Code sign passed;
  silent-install / add-remove / bundleware came back *unknown* because the sandbox looks for a
  machine-wide uninstall entry and this is a per-user install.

Known rough edge: **acrylic renders as a solid tint on build 26200** — `SetWindowCompositionAttribute`
no longer blurs on current Windows 11. Real blur needs the DWM SystemBackdrop path (roadmap). The
surface still tints correctly to the theme.

## Roadmap
- v0.1 (this scaffold): everything above, static tiles, single primary-monitor taskbar.
- v0.2: multi-monitor (open on the monitor whose Start button was clicked), group drag,
  keyboard navigation polish, jump-list on right-click (recent files), localisation.
- v0.3: MSIX/winget package, Start folder ("Windows Tools") virtual folders, tile badges.
- Not planned: true live tiles (the platform API no longer exists on Windows 11).
